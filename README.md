# Shipment Delay Prediction App

A predictive analytics web application that uses machine learning to forecast shipment delays based on historical data and shipment attributes. The app provides actionable insights for supply chain management.

## Features
- Upload shipment data in CSV format.
- Predict delays based on attributes like distance, weight, carrier type, and weather.
- Intuitive dashboard with data visualizations and predictions.
- Export results for further analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js/Vanilla JS).
- **Backend**: Python (Flask/Django) or Node.js (Express.js) for prediction API.
- **Machine Learning**: Trained models using scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.
- **Database**: MongoDB/MySQL (optional for storing shipment data).
- **Visualization**: Plotly, Chart.js, or D3.js.
- **Hosting**: Netlify for deployment.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (for frontend development).
- Python (for the ML API).
- Netlify CLI (optional for local testing).

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pritisingh196/shipment-delay-prediction.git
   cd shipment-delay-prediction
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   - For the frontend:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - For the backend:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Run the development server**:
   - Frontend:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - Backend:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```

4. **Build for production** (frontend):
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Machine Learning Model
- **Model**: A pre-trained classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Neural Network).
- **Features**: Shipment details like `distance`, `weight`, `carrier type`, `shipment priority`, `departure time`, and `weather`.
- **Training Data**: Dataset containing historical shipment records with labeled delays.

## Deployment on Netlify
1. **Create a Netlify account** at [Netlify](https://shipmentdelayprediction.netlify.app/).
2. **Link your GitHub repository**:
   - Navigate to the Netlify dashboard and select **New Site from Git**.
   - Select your GitHub repository and the desired branch (`main` or `master`).
3. **Set build settings**:
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`.
   - **Publish directory**: `build/`.
4. **Deploy the app**:
   - Click **Deploy Site** to trigger the build and deployment.
5. **Connect the Backend**:
   - Use Netlify's environment variables or serverless functions to interact with the ML API hosted on a separate platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku, or locally).

## Usage
1. Open the deployed application on your browser.
2. Upload a CSV file containing shipment data.
3. View predictions and visualizations on the dashboard.
4. Export the results for further use.

## Example CSV Format
| Shipment ID | Distance | Weight | Carrier Type | Shipment Priority | Departure Time  | Weather Conditions |  
|-------------|----------|--------|--------------|-------------------|---------------- |--------------------|  
| 1001        | 500      | 25     | Air          | High              | 2024-01-10 08:00| Clear              |  
| 1002        | 300      | 15     | Ground       | Medium            | 2024-01-11 12:00| Rainy              |
